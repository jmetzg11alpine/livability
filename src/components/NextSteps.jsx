        If there is nothing in the pipeline and other teammates can cover my
        work, I would like to help include this into the product.
      </p>
      <p>I would consider it a great opportunity to build additional skills</p>
      <p>
        Clearly, I'm not qualified to do this, and therefore I would consider a
        sizeable paycut to be fair.
      </p>
      <br></br>
      <p>
        At the very least I would like you to know that I'm working hard after
        hours, and I share the goal of helping the company become more
        successful.
